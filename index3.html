<h2>What is an ethical hacking?</h2>
<b><p>Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data.<br> Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers.<br> This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.<br>
From a technical standpoint, Ethical Hacking is the process of bypassing or cracking security measures implemented by a system to find out vulnerabilities, data breaches, and potential threats.<br> It is only deemed ethical if the regional or organizational cyber laws/rules are followed. <br>This job is formally known as penetration testing.<br> As the name suggests, this practice involves trying to infiltrate the system and documenting the steps involved in it.<br>
To sum it up, an Ethical Hacker hacks the target system before any harmful hacker can. This allows the security team of the organization to apply a security patch in the system and effectively eliminate an opening for the attacker to enter the system or execute a hack.
Ethical Hacking sometimes called as Penetration Testing is an act of intruding/penetrating into system or networks to find out threats, vulnerabilities in those systems which a malicious attacker may find and exploit causing loss of data, financial loss or other major damages.<br>The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security of the network or systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing.<br> Ethical hackers may use the same methods and tools used by the malicious hackers but with the permission of the authorized person for the purpose of improving the security and defending the systems from attacks by malicious users.<br>
Ethical hackers are expected to report all the vulnerabilities and weakness found during the process to the management.</p></b>
<h3>How are ethical hackers different than malicious hackers?</h3>
<p>Ethical hackers use their knowledge to secure and improve the technology of organizations. They provide an essential service to these organizations by looking for vulnerabilities that can lead to a security breach.

An ethical hacker reports the identified vulnerabilities to the organization. Additionally, they provide remediation advice. In many cases, with the organization’s consent, the ethical hacker performs a re-test to ensure the vulnerabilities are fully resolved. 

Malicious hackers intend to gain unauthorized access to a resource (the more sensitive the better) for financial gain or personal recognition. Some malicious hackers deface websites or crash backend servers for fun, reputation damage, or to cause financial loss. The methods used and vulnerabilities found remain unreported. They aren’t concerned with improving the organizations security posture.</p>
<h4>What are the key concepts of ethical hacking?</h4><br>
<p><b>Hacking experts follow four key protocol concepts:</b><br>
 <b>Stay legal.</b> Obtain proper approval before accessing and performing a security assessment.<br>
 <b>Define the scope.</b><br> Determine the scope of the assessment so that the ethical hacker’s work remains legal and within the organization’s approved boundaries.<br>
 <b>Report vulnerabilities.</b>Notify the organization of all vulnerabilities discovered during the assessment. Provide remediation advice for resolving these vulnerabilities.<br>
 <b>Respect data sensitivity.</b>Depending on the data sensitivity, ethical hackers may have to agree to a non-disclosure agreement, in addition to other terms and conditions required by the assessed organization. <br>
